## About
Wakatiwai is a boot manager for x86_64 UEFI, written in Rust. It supports any file system and any operating system by using runtime drivers.

## Features
 - **‚öôÔ∏è Easy JSON Configuration**
 - **üìÅ [Multiple File Systems](#supported-filesystems)**
 - **üíø [Multiple Operating Systems](#supported-program-types)**
 - **ü§ù Dynamic driver interop**

## Download
Wakatiwai is currently available for the following Linux distros:
 - Arch Linux (AUR)

Alternatively, you can manually build Wakatiwai from source, by cloning and running `./setup/setup-<OS>.sh`, where `<OS>` is the operating system/Linux distribution you use (or a derivative, i.e. use `arch` for Manjaro).

(Missing a setup script for your OS? Make one and submit a pull request!)

## Installation
Wakatiwai can be installed on your machine by running:

```$ sudo wakatiwai-install <ESP> [driverlist]```

Where `<ESP>` is the mountpoint of the EFI system partition you wish to install Wakatiwai to. Note that this partition must be at least 300MB in size and be formatted to FAT32. `[driverlist]` is an optional argument that defaults to `/etc/wakatiwai/driverlist` - the given file will list the official and custom drivers to be built and used by the bootloader.

The `/EFI/wakatiwai` directory will be created within `<ESP>` and will contain the following:
 - `wakatiwai.efi` - the boot manager itself
 - `wtconfig.json` - the [configuration file](#configuration) for the boot manager
 - `drivers/boot/` - a directory containing OS loader drivers
 - `drivers/fs/` - a directory containing file system drivers

Note that custom drivers can be created and placed in these directories to be used by the boot manager (submit a PR for official support!).

## Usage
Upon starting the boot manager, you will be greeted with a list of menu options. Use the up and down keys to focus one of these options, and press the space or enter keys to boot the focused option.

The following keys also have functions:

| Key | Function                 |
| --- | ------------------------ |
| F5  | Restarts the boot manager. |
| F12 | Powers off the system.   |

## Configuration
The aforementioned `wtconfig.json` file accepts the following **case-sensitive** properties and values:

| Property      | Type        | Default    | Required | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `loglevel`    | String      | `"NORMAL"` | ‚úò        | Describes how much logging information will be outputted by the boot manager.

This option will not be presented if the firmware does not support this action.**                                                                                                                    |
| `editconfig`  | Boolean     | `true`     | ‚úò        | If `true`, the boot manager will present the option to edit the local `wtconfig.json` for future boots in the boot menu.<br><br>**WARNING: If set to `false`, mistakes in the boot manager's configuration might only be fixable from another operating system - your system may become unbootable.**                     |
